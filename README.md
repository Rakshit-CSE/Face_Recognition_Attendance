# Face_Recognition_Attendance
Developed an automated attendance system using facial recognition, enabling attendance marking through a phone on the same network.

The process of using a phone camera with Python:
First, install the OpenCV library in Python; pip install opencv-python.
Download and install the IP Webcam application on your smartphones.
After installing the IP Webcam app, make sure your phone and PC are connected to the same network. Run the app on your phone and click Start Server.
After that, your camera will open with an IP address at the bottom. Copy the IP address as we will need to use it in our Python code to open your phoneâ€™s camera.
